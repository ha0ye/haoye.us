  About Hao Ye
---

I am motivated to use my expertise to solve interesting and impactful problems. Lately, that has been through teaching and developing training materials, and collaborating to achieve systemic change in research practices.

My academic background has spanned several different fields, including computer science, psychology, oceanography, and ecology. Currently, I focus on open research / open science and reproducibility practices.

More broadly, I am interested in making academia and society more inclusive and open, to improve accessibility to knowledge. After many years spent working on data and software, I have become more intentionally collaborative to tackle these larger scale problems. I enjoy working with other people on initiatives, so [get in touch](../contact) if you want to chat!
