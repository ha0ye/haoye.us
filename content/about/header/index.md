  About Hao Ye
---

I am the Curriculum Lead for the [Community for Rigor](https://c4r.io/).

I am interested in reforming research systems to be more humane, welcoming, inclusive, and equitable.
This encompasses a variety of movements, including:

* open research (perhaps more popularly known as "open science")
* researcher training
* labor conditions and incentive alignment

My primary motivation is to use my expertise to solve interesting and impactful problems, with the goal of making academia and society more inclusive and open. After many years spent working on data and software, I have become more intentionally collaborative to tackle these larger scale problems. I enjoy working with other people on initiatives, so [get in touch](../contact) if you want to chat!
