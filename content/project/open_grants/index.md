### About

This [IMLS-funded](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-250067-ols-21) project explores the potential for an open repository of funding proposals to elevate their recognition as scholarly products, improve access for the public and other grant seekers, and bring transparency to this facet of the research process.

This site builds on the longstanding [OGrants](https://www.ogrants.org/) project, led by Ethan White, to document a new phase of discussion, needs assessment, and technical planning for a repository of open grants.

### Objectives
The planning project will:
1.  convene diverse groups of stakeholders so that a multifaceted research ecosystem is represented throughout the planning process;
2.  develop a metadata schema and aggregation plan for organizing grant proposals and related documents (e.g., funder program guidelines); and
3.  investigate the social and technical challenges and opportunities for creating and maintaining an open grants repository.

The central question that will guide this process is not "how can we make every grant proposal openly available?", but rather "how can we proceed strategically to facilitate sharing where it will have the most benefit?"
