description: I am passionate about empowering individuals and teams to work openly. I believe that working openly facilitates collaborations, makes the work better, and is a pathway towards disrupting inequitable power structures. In addition to training researchers in project, data, and computing, I also lead [Ally Skills](https://alligatorallyskills.weebly.com/) workshops on how to use everyday actions to improve inclusion and accessibility.
