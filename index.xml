      <description>About     This IMLS-funded project explores the potential for an open repository of funding proposals to elevate their recognition as scholarly products, improve access for the public and other grant seekers, and bring transparency to this facet of the research process.
This site builds on the longstanding OGrants project, led by Ethan White, to document a new phase of discussion, needs assessment, and technical planning for a repository of open grants.</description>

      <description>Inclusion Rider     For invited engagements, please note that I use the following inclusion rider.
I strive for events where the invited [speakers/panelists/etc] are representative of the diversity (along whichever axes) of the appropriate audience. If your event has not yet considered inclusive representation or you feel that there are improvements to be made, I would be happy to step down and/or suggest alternative speakers.

      <description>Teaching Philosophy     I strive to make my teaching accessible and actionable, through setting expectations up front, and developing content and exercises that center learning.
My formal training comes from:
 &amp;ldquo;Teaching + Learning at the College Level&amp;rdquo;, a course on evidence-based teaching practices taught by UCSD&amp;rsquo;s Teaching + Learning Commons. (The course is now called &amp;ldquo;Introduction to College Teaching&amp;rdquo;.) The Carpentries Instructor Training and Trainer Training.</description>
