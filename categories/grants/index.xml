      <description>About     This IMLS-funded project explores the potential for an open repository of funding proposals to elevate their recognition as scholarly products, improve access for the public and other grant seekers, and bring transparency to this facet of the research process.
This site builds on the longstanding OGrants project, led by Ethan White, to document a new phase of discussion, needs assessment, and technical planning for a repository of open grants.</description>
